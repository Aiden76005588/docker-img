Applying Rolling Patch to the Base Image

This sample offers Dockerfile for building Docker image with the Oracle Tuxedo 12.2.2 rolling patch applied.

Dependencies

This sample is based on the oracle/tuxedoartrttma:12.2.2 base image. So, before you proceed to build this image, make sure the image oracle/tuxedoartrttma:12.2.2 has been built locally or is accessible in a remote Docker registry.

To build this image, the rolling patch package should be downloaded from My Oracle Support and put into the same directory as the Dockerfile.

The latest rolling patch is always recommended, while you can actually use any patch level. The downloaded file name should be in the format of p*_12220_Linux-x86-64.zip, for example, the Tuxedo 12.2.2 RP003 file is p24444780_122200_Linux-x86-64.zip.

Building the Image

Once you have put the patch package in place, run below command to build:

docker build -t oracle/tuxedoartrttma:12.2.2.1 .

    It is recommended to give read permission to all users on the downloaded binary files before building the image. Otherwise the resulting image will most probably get 50M larger.

Running Oracle Tuxedo in a Docker container

Nothing has changed to use this image from running the base image. Please refer to the README file in the root directory for detail.
