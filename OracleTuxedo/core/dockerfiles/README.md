# Introduction
This folder contains the information on how to create a Tuxedo docker image based and two examples for how to use [Tuxedo](http://oracle.com/tuxedo) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## To use
1. Into an empty directory:
  1. Download the Tuxedo 12.1.3 or 12.2.2 Linux 64 bit installer from [OTN](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/tuxedo/downloads/index.html)
  2. Download all the files from this GitHub repository to a local directory
  3. Drop the downloaded Tuxedo installer to the corresponding version directory
  4. Optionally download the latest Tuxedo rolling patch from My Oracle Support
2. Into the local directory
3. Execute ``./buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.1.3 -i tuxedo121300_64_Linux_01_x86.zip -s`` to create an image for Tuxedo 12.1.3.

Notes:
   1. Before you run buildDockerImage.sh, if your Tuxedo was other than 12.1.3, you need change above command according to version, and installer name. For instance, 12.2.2 for version and tuxedo122200_64_Linux_01_x86.zip for the installer name.
   2. Before you run buildDockerImage.sh, if proxy is needed to access network, you need to set environment variables at first: http_proxy, https_proxy, ftp_proxy, no_proxy
   3. The base image oracle/serverjre:8 should be built before you run buildDockerImage.sh. To build the base image, you must first download the Oracle Server JRE binary and drop in folder ../OracleJava/java-8 and build that image. For more information, visit the [OracleJava](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleJava) folder's [README](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleJava/README.md) file.

    $ cd ../OracleJava/java-8
    $ sh build.sh


You should end up with a docker image tagged oracle/tuxedo:<version>, version is Tuxedo version number you may modify in buildDockerImage.sh.
Have fun!
