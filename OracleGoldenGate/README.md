## Before You Start
This project provides a Dockerfile tested with:

- Oracle GoldenGate 12.2.0.1.1 for Oracle
- Oracle GoldenGate 12.3.0.1.4 for Oracle
- Oracle GoldenGate 12.3.0.1.4 Microservices for Oracle
- Oracle GoldenGate 18.1.0.0.0 for Oracle
- Oracle GoldenGate 18.1.0.0.0 Microservices for Oracle
- Oracle GoldenGate 19.1.0.0.2 for Oracle
- Oracle GoldenGate 19.1.0.0.2 Microservices for Oracle

To build the images, use the [dockerBuild.sh](dockerBuild.sh) script or follow the instructions for manually building an image.

**IMPORTANT:** To create images for Oracle GoldenGate on Docker, you must use Docker version 17.05.0 or later. You can check the version of Docker on your system with the `docker version` command.

**IMPORTANT:** You must download the installation binaries of Oracle GoldenGate. You only need to provide the binaries for the version you plan to install. The binaries can be downloaded from the [Oracle Technology Network](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/goldengate/downloads/index.html). Do not uncompress the Oracle GoldenGate ZIP file. The `dockerBuild.sh` script will handle that for you. You also must have Internet connectivity when building the Docker image for the package manager to perform additional software installations.

**IMPORTANT:** The Docker Base Image should be prepared before you start creating Oracle GoldenGate Docker Image. Please refer the section [Changing the Base Image](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleGoldenGate#changing-the-base-image) regarding the base images.

All shell commands in this document assume the usage of Bash shell.

For more information about Oracle GoldenGate please see the [Oracle GoldenGate 12c On-line Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/c1230/gg-winux/index.html).

## Option 1 - Using `dockerBuild.sh` to Build Oracle GoldenGate Docker Images
Once you have downloaded the Oracle GoldenGate software, run the `dockerBuild.sh` script without command line options to view usage instructions:

    $ ./dockerBuild.sh
    Oracle GoldenGate distribution ZIP file not specified.

    Usage: dockerBuild.sh [-h | <ogg-zip-file-name>] [<docker-build-options> ...]
    Where:
      ogg-zip-file-name       Name of OGG ZIP file
      docker-build-options    Command line options for Docker build

    Example:
      ./dockerBuild.sh ~/Downloads/123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.zip --no-cache

When the name of an Oracle GoldenGate ZIP file is specified, the result of `dockerBuild.sh` will be a Docker image with the Oracle GoldenGate binaries installed. Created Docker images will follow the naming convention of **oracle/goldengate-&lt;edition&gt;:&lt;version&gt;**, for example:

- `oracle/goldengate-standard:12.2.0.1.1`
- `oracle/goldengate-standard:12.3.0.1.4`
- `oracle/goldengate-microservices:12.3.0.1.4`

The `dockerBuild.sh` script determines the version and edition of Oracle GoldenGate by inspecting the ZIP file.

**IMPORTANT:** When creating Docker images for *Oracle GoldenGate for Oracle*, the `dockerBuild.sh` script automatically selects the Oracle GoldenGate software for Oracle RDBMS 12c. To create Docker images for a different version of Oracle RDBMS, follow the instructions for **Option 2**.

### Docker Build Options
When using `dockerBuild.sh`, all command line options after the name of the Oracle GoldenGate ZIP file are passed directly to the `docker build` command. This allows you to modify the behavior of `docker build`. For example, adding `--no-cache` to the `dockerBuild.sh` command line instructs Docker to not use cached images when building the Oracle GoldenGate Docker image. The `--tag` option can be used to give the new Docker image a custom tag.

The following example creates a Oracle GoldenGate Docker image and names it `devops/goldengate-microservices:production`. Output from `docker build` is not shown unless an error occurs.

    $ ./dockerBuild.sh ~/Downloads/123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.zip --tag devops/goldengate-microservices:production --quiet

## Option 2 - Manually Building Oracle GoldenGate Docker Images
Building an Oracle GoldenGate Docker image can be done manually, without using the **`dockerBuild.sh`** script, by following the steps in this section.

First, the installation media must be extracted from the downloaded ZIP file and converted to a TAR file for the Docker build process. The extraction process depends on the version of Oracle GoldenGate downloaded.

### Extracting *Oracle GoldenGate for Oracle* Installation Media
The *Oracle GoldenGate for Oracle* software is packaged differently than for other databases. If *Oracle GoldenGate for Oracle* was downloaded, locate the appropriate `filegroup1.jar` file and extract it.  For example, *Oracle GoldenGate 12.3.0.1.4 Microservices for Oracle* contains two candidates:

    $ unzip -l ~/Downloads/123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.zip | grep 'oracle.oggcore.*.ora.*filegroup1.jar'
    125089328  2018-04-16 05:46   fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome/Disk1/stage/Components/oracle.oggcore.services.ora11g/12.3.0.1.2/1/DataFiles/filegroup1.jar
    119782012  2018-04-16 05:45   fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome/Disk1/stage/Components/oracle.oggcore.services.ora12c/12.3.0.1.2/1/DataFiles/filegroup1.jar


The `filegroup1.jar` for Oracle RDBMS 12c can be extracted into the current directory with a command like this:

    $ unzip -j ~/Downloads/123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.zip \
               fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome/Disk1/stage/Components/oracle.oggcore.services.ora12c/12.3.0.1.2/1/DataFiles/filegroup1.jar

Then, conversion of `filegroup1.jar` to `123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.tar` is done with this command:

    $ unzip -q filegroup1.jar -d ./oggcore && \
      tar Ccf ./oggcore 123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.tar --owner=54321 --group=54321 . && \
      rm -fr  ./oggcore

**NOTE:** The group id and owner id of '54321' is used by the Dockerfile when creating the 'oracle' user account.

When the above commands are executed successfully, the resulting TAR file, `123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.tar`, will be used by the Dockerfile to create the Oracle GoldenGate image. Pass the filename to the Docker build command with the `OGG_TARFILE` build argument. This is covered in greater detail in a later section.

### Extracting *Oracle GoldenGate* Installation Media for non-Oracle Databases
For non-Oracle databases, the installation software is packaged as a TAR file in a ZIP file, along with release notes.

    $ unzip -lv ~/Downloads/123011_ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.zip
    Archive:  /home/sbalousek/Downloads/123011_ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.zip
     Length   Method    Size  Cmpr    Date    Time   CRC-32   Name
    --------  ------  ------- ---- ---------- ----- --------  ----
    260648960  Defl:N 62574810  76% 2017-08-05 07:25 2dcd70bf  ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.tar
        1542  Defl:N      559  64% 2017-08-13 16:22 cb9f1c1b  OGG-12.3.0.1-README.txt
      181443  Defl:N   139000  23% 2017-08-13 16:22 92c6c95c  OGG_WinUnix_Rel_Notes_12.3.0.1.pdf
    --------          -------  ---                            -------
    260831945         62714369  76%                            3 files

Extract the TAR file with a command like:

    $ unzip ~/Downloads/123011_ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.zip ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.tar

**NOTE:** The name of the TAR file depends on the version of Oracle GoldenGate that was downloaded.

Optionally, rebuild the TAR file using the group and user identifiers 54321:54321. If this step is skipped, the resulting image file will be larger than necessary.

    $ mkdir ./oggcore && \
      tar Cxf ./oggcore ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.tar && \
      tar Ccf ./oggcore ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.tar --owner=54321 --group=54321 . && \
      rm -fr  ./oggcore

**NOTE:** The group id and owner id of '54321' is used by the Dockerfile when creating the 'oracle' user account.

When the above commands are executed successfully, the resulting TAR file, `ggs_Linux_x64_MySQL_64bit.tar`, can be used by the Dockerfile to create the Oracle GoldenGate image. Pass the filename to the Docker build command with the `OGG_TARFILE` build argument. This is described in the next section.

### Building the Docker image
Once the TAR file is created, the Docker image can be built. The Dockerfile requires three build arguments be defined for the `docker build` command.

- `OGG_VERSION` - The Oracle GoldenGate version used for the Docker image. "12.3.0.1.4", for example. This value is used to set the `OGG_VERSION` environment variable in the resulting Docker image and is otherwise not used.
- `OGG_EDITION` - The Oracle GoldenGate edition, either "standard" or "microservices". This value determines the additional software added to the Docker image.
- `OGG_TARFILE` - The name of the TAR file extracted using the commands above. The TAR file must be located in the same directory as `Dockerfile`.

An Oracle GoldenGate Docker image is built with a `docker build` command like this:

    $ docker build --build-arg OGG_VERSION="12.3.0.1.4" \
                   --build-arg OGG_EDITION="microservices" \
                   --build-arg OGG_TARFILE="123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.tar" \
                   --tag oracle/goldengate-microservices:12.3.0.1.4 --no-cache .

## Changing the Base Image
By default, the base image used by Docker to build Oracle GoldenGate Docker images is `oracle/instantclient:12.2.0.1`. The Oracle Instant Client image can be built using the files in [OracleInstantClient](../OracleInstantClient). You can change the base image used by the Oracle GoldenGate Docker images if your Oracle GoldenGate software is for a non-Oracle RDBMS or if you have more complex requirements of the Oracle GoldenGate Docker image.

The base image is changed by setting the environment variable `BASE_IMAGE` when executing the `dockerBuild.sh` script as described in **Option 1** above. This example uses an Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2.0.1) Enterprise Edition image created using the files in [OracleDatabase](../OracleDatabase):

    $ BASE_IMAGE="oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee" ./dockerBuild.sh ~/Downloads/123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.zip

When manually creating the Docker image (see **Option 2**), the base image is specified as a Docker build argument. For example, using an Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2.0.1) Enterprise Edition base image is done with a command like this:

    $ docker build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE="oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee" \
                   --build-arg OGG_VERSION="12.3.0.1.4" \
                   --build-arg OGG_EDITION="microservices" \
                   --build-arg OGG_TARFILE="123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.tar" \
                   --tag oracle/goldengate-microservices:12.3.0.1.4 --no-cache .

## Running a Command from the Base Image
If the base image provides run-time services, they can be specified at Docker image build time with the `BASE_COMMAND` argument. They can also be specified at run time with the `BASE_COMMAND` environment variable. The command specified by `BASE_COMMAND` will be executed in the background, before the Oracle GoldenGate services are run. For example, when the Oracle GoldenGate Docker image is based on `oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee`, the RDBMS services can be specified with this command:

    $ BASE_IMAGE="oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee" ./dockerBuild.sh ~/Downloads/123014_fbo_ggs_Linux_x64_services_shiphome.zip --build-arg BASE_COMMAND="runuser -u oracle -- /opt/oracle/runOracle.sh"

## Running Oracle GoldenGate in a Docker container
To run your Oracle GoldenGate Docker image use a **docker run** command like this:

    $ docker run --name <container name> \
        --cap-add SYS_RESOURCE \
        -e OGG_SCHEMA=<schema for OGG> \
        -e OGG_ADMIN=<admin user name> \
        -e OGG_ADMIN_PWD=<admin password> \
        -e OGG_DEPLOYMENT=<deployment name for Microservices Architecture> \
        -e PORT_BASE=11000 \
        -p 8443:443 \
        -v <host mount point>:<container-mount-point> ... \
        <image name>

Parameters:

- `<container name>`  - The name of the container (default: auto generated)
- `--cap-add SYS_RESOURCE` - Required privileges for Docker container to allow `su - oracle`
- `-e OGG_SCHEMA`     - The GGSCHEMA to use for OGG (default: `oggadmin`)
- `-e OGG_ADMIN`      - The name of the administrative account to create for Microservices Architecture (default: `oggadmin`)
- `-e OGG_ADMIN_PWD`  - The password for the Microservices Architecture administrative account (default: auto generated)
- `-e OGG_DEPLOYMENT` - The name of the deployment for Microservices Architecture (default: `Local`)
- `-e PORT_BASE`      - The starting port number used by OGG services (default: 7809 for Classic Edition, 9100 for Microservices Edition)
- `<image name>`      - The Docker image name created using **Option 1** or **Option 2**

**NOTE:** Only the `OGG_SCHEMA` environment variable is used by Oracle GoldenGate Standard Edition containers. The other environment variables are used by the Microservices Architecture.

### Volumes
Mount points for Oracle GoldenGate Standard Edition are located in the container under the `/u01/app/ogg/` directory. For example:

- `/u01/app/ogg/dirprm` - The parameter file directory
- `/u01/app/ogg/dirdat` - The standard trail file directory

For the Microservices Architecture, Oracle GoldenGate data is located under the `/u02/ogg` directory. Some examples are:

- `/u02/ogg/Local/etc/conf`     - Configuration files for the 'Local' deployment
- `/u02/ogg/Local/var/lib/data` - Trail files for the 'Local' deployment

### Ports

Depending on the OGG Edition, the container will expose one or more ports starting at
`PORT_BASE`. For the Microservices Edition, the container will also expose a Load Balancer on
port 443. To publish the Manager port from a Classic Edition container from the Docker host, use the
`--publish` (`-p`) option for `docker run`. For example:

    -p 7809:7809

For a Microservices Edition container, there are two options.

1. Publish the port of the embedded load balancer to access all the microservices from a single port (preferred)

    ```
    -p 8443:443
    ```

2. Publish the ports from individual OGG Microservices:

    ```
    -p 9100:9100   # Service Manager
    -p 9101:9101   # Administration Server
    -p 9102:9102   # Distribution Server
    -p 9103:9103   # Receiver Server
    -p 9104:9104   # Performance Metrics Server
    ```

### SSL Certificate for Microservices Architecture
When the Oracle GoldenGate Docker image is created for Microservices Architecture, a dummy SSL certificate is generated for the OGG Web UI. Your own SSL certificate can be used instead of the dummy certificate like this:

    docker run --name ogg-test \
        -e OGG_SCHEMA=ggadmin \
        -e OGG_ADMIN=oggadmin \
        -v /path/to/certificate.pem:/etc/nginx/ogg.pem \
        oracle/goldengate-microservices:12.3.0.1.4

The certificate file, `/path/to/certificate.pem`, needs to contain a full certificate chain including the private key and all intermediate and root CA public keys. For example:

    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQDCqx5mEeaMNCqr

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

### Administrative Account Password for Microservices Architecture
On the first startup of a Microservices Architecture container, a random password will be generated for the Oracle GoldenGate administrative user if not provided by the `OGG_ADMIN_PWD` environment variable. You can find this password at the start of the Docker container log:

    $ docker logs <container name> 2>/dev/null | head -3
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    --  Password for administrative user 'oggadmin' is 'qVc3bqNlwijk'
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Running GGSCI in an OGG Standard Edition Docker container
The **GGSCI** utility can be run in the OGG container with this command:

    $ docker exec -ti --user oracle <container name> ggsci

**GGSCI** is not installed for containers created with the Microservices Architecture.

### Running Admin Client in an OGG Microservices Architecture Docker container
The **Admin Client** utility can be run in the OGG container with this command:

    $ docker exec -ti --user oracle <container name> adminclient

**Admin Client** is only available in containers created with the Microservices Architecture.

## Additional Utilities
Additional utilities, installed to the Docker Image at `/usr/local/bin`, can be found in the [bin](bin) directory.

## Known issues
None
